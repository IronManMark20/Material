# Material PySide (and maybe PyQt)
A collection of PyQt Widgets for theming applications to give a material design look.

Currently, only PySide (and probably PyQt4) and Python2 are supported.

This is a repository for Material Design qt stylesheets and widgets. Currently, the following widgets are supported (not all implemented right now):

- QSlider - implemented
- QLineEdit - not implemented
- QTextEdit - not implemented
- QPushButton - FAB, Raised and Flat
- QTabBar - implemented
- QListView - not implemented
- QProgressBar - partially implemented
- QRadioButton (as a QCheckBox) - implemented, acts as a checkbox

QPushButton has 3 styles: Flat, Raised, and Floating Action. To read more on these styles [read the button spec](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html).

This is still very much a work in progress. To see the example, run the `material.py` file. It will give you an example application. (Still very much a work in progress).
