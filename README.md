# Material PySide
A collection of PySide Widgets for theming applications to give a material design look.

Currently, only PySide and Python2 are working. Python3 will be tested soon.

This is a repository for Material Design qt stylesheets and widgets. Currently, the following widgets are supported (not all implemented right now):

- Slider -  not implemented (vertical and horizontal)
- LineEdit - implemented
- TextEdit - not implemented
- PushButton - FAB, Raised and Flat
- TabBar - implemented
- ListView - implemented
- ProgressBar - implemented
- Checkbox - implemented
- TopBar - implemented
- Dialog - not implemented

QPushButton has 3 styles: Flat, Raised, and Floating Action. To read more on these styles [read the button spec](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html).

Also, I have added a custom Text class which uses Roboto font as a bonus.

This is still very much a work in progress. To see the example, run the `example.py` file. It will give you an example application. (Still very much a work in progress).
