^^ I am often on Gitter so you will find me there.


A collection of PySide Widgets for theming applications to give a material design look.

Currently, only PySide for Qt4 is working. Python 2.7 and 3.x works!

Currently, the following widgets are supported (not all implemented right now):

- LineEdit - implemented
- TextEdit - not implemented (v0.2)
- PushButton - FAB, Raised and Flat
- TabBar - implemented
- ListView - implemented
- ProgressBar - implemented
- Checkbox - implemented
- TopBar - implemented
- Dialog - not implemented (v0.2)

QPushButton has 3 styles: Flat, Raised, and Floating Action. To read more on these styles [read the button spec](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html).

Also, I have added a custom Text class which uses Roboto font as a bonus.

To see the example, run the `example.py` file. It will give you an example application.

Also, the wiki will have documentation for each widget. To start though, you can read through the source of `example.py` for examples.

#Contributing

I take pull requests! Let me know if you are interested in contributing. The best way would be to open a new issue with the widget or fix you are going to work on. Fork the project, and push commits to that. Then, when you are done, you can make a pull request. I will check the changes you made and either approve it, or explain how it can be fixed.
